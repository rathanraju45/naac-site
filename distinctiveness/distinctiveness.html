        </p>
        <br />
        <p><span>NPTEL & MOOCs:<br /></span>In the NPTEL online courses 10 faculty received gold medals, 7 faculty stood
            in
            the top 5 and 3 faculty stood in the top 1 in their respective subjects across the country. 1000+ Students

            students of MIC to take NPTEL & MOOC Courses.
            CRDC:The College Research and Development Cell (CRDC) provides supportive research environment with special
            incentives. To keep the abreast of the latest trends in industry the college has initiated various programs
            and tie-ups.

            <span>Excellence in Academics& Sports:<br></span>
            Koneru Greeshma(17H71A0473) Topper in ECE received Prof.V.V.L Rao Memorial Endowment Cash Prize from JNTUK,
            Kakinada.

        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            <span>Skill Orientation:<br /></span>
            The goal of education is all about preparing students towards employment. While bookish knowledge helps them
            understand the topic, it is only when they apply that knowledge to a specific trade that they will shine in
            their jobs. Skill-based training, not only enhances employability but also drives the competencies in
            students to try their hand in various disciplines. Our Curriculum encourages Skill-enhancement among
            students.MOU’s with various organizations like ICT Academy, Oracle Academy, IBMSkillBuild, AP Skill
            Development cell etc, are made to enhance the skillset of the student.
            To achieve this MIC has collaborated with EduSkills to provide industry Internships to students from
            different corporate academies like AWS, Blue Prism, Juniper, Alteryx, Microchip, Celonis, Fortinet etc.
            In the last two years more than 2500 students have successfully registered & completed Virtual internships
            from these corporate academies. Because of these efforts, Eduskills awarded MIC College a 36th National rank
            out of 1000+ colleges in the academic year 2022-23.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            <span>Value Based Education:<br /></span>
            Value-based education aims at training the student to face the world with the right approach, attitude and
            values. It is a process of overall personality development which will ultimately help them get ready for
            career and life. Programs by famous inspirational speakers like Rajesh Murthy, Squadron Leader Jayasimha,
            Yendamuri Veerendranath and Dr. Pattabhiraman are frequently conducted to students of MIC.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            <span>Mentoring:<br /></span>
            Mentoring isn’t mere sharing of knowledge. Mentors help Mentees identify their own strengths and weaknesses
            by doing SWOT/SWOC Analysis. They help the Mentees identify their SMART (Specific, Measurable, Achievable,
            Realistic and Time-bound) goals, encourage them, and guide them in the process of achieving their goals, or
            help them understand ways and means of solving any challenges that might come along the way.
            Mentees/Protégés benefit from mentorship programs by:
            <br />
            • Identifying their own strengths and opportunities.<br />
            • Weakening their weaknesses and converting them into strengths.<br />
            • Making use of opportunities to their advantage.<br />
            • Understanding threats/challenges/fears/anxieties and overcoming them.<br />
            • Setting realistic goals.<br />
            • Receiving constructive feedback.<br />
            • Checking the progress regularly, and<br />
            • Being open to fresh ideas to accomplish their goals.<br />
            <span>Mentorship is an art in itself: <br /></span> It is not everyone’s cup of tea. It takes skill,
            precision, caring attitude,
            and amiable nature to make someone a good Mentor. Mentorship is one of the most personal and
            relationship-building learning experiences.<br />
            • A few members of the faculty are identified to Mentor the students of the department. Each one of them has
            to take care of 20 students. Once a Mentor is allotted 20 Mentees to his/her care, it becomes his/her
            responsibility to travel with them, understand their needs and goals and channelize their energies in the
            way they wish to go. ‘Helping the Mentees tread the path they wish to tread’ is the primary duty of a
            Mentor. ‘Together we can’ is the guidance force of mentorship at its best.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
            <span>Problem Solving Methodologies:<br /></span>
            When life throws a challenge, many succumb to pressure. The students at MIC are trained to handle
            stress-filled
            situations by making use of various problem-solving methodologies that are in vogue.MIC Students are trained
            by
            in-house faculty &various external corporate agencies.
        </p>

        <p>
            <span>Entrepreneurship Programs:<br /></span>
            This is the age of startups and enterprises driven by young engineers who wish to create jobs instead of
            being a
            mere employee. There are ample opportunities on campus to help the budding entrepreneurs develop into
            full-fledged entrepreneurs through programs like ISB-TEP, VDC etc.
        </p>

        <p>
            <span>Information & Communications Technology:<br /></span>
            Traditional methods of teaching have become obsolete. Instead, the use of ICT in education improves
            engagement
            and knowledge retention: ICTs are used in education in two general ways: to support existing ‘traditional’
            pedagogical practices (teacher-centric, lecture-based, rote learning) as well as to enable more
            learner-centric,
            ‘constructivist’ learning models.
