                <h2>Department Of Basic Engineering<br>
                    … We Provide The RIGHT Foundation</h2>
                <p>Engineering and science are, by their very nature, humanistic and socially derived enterprises. The Department of Basic Engineering plays an impact-creating role in an institute where the ethos of science and technology emerge. Hence a complete science and technology education must include subjects that help unite application of scientific principles with human, moral and social understanding. The subjects taught by this department are meant to sensitize students to the broader social, cultural, economic, ethical and humane issues involved in social change.
                    <br><br>
                    The Department of Basic Engineering was established in the year 2002. It provides a launch pad for the engineering study by teaching students the foundation courses in various subjects of science and humanities. The department also aims to provide knowledge in the vicinities of Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, and Humanities to the students of engineering to set a strong foundation for respective core Engineering disciplines.
                    <br><br>
                    The faculty members of the department are fully slotted into research activities under various sponsored projects in collaboration with premier institutes and have been publishing research papers in journals of National and International repute.
                    <br>
                    The department has major core laboratories like Engineering Physics, Engineering Chemistry, and Computer-Aided Multimedia English Language that are fully equipped and play an indispensable role in students’ career.

                <h3>About the Association:</h3>
                <div id="seamic-grp">
                    <p id="seamic-p">
                        <span class="bold-head">System Engineers Association of MIC (SEAMIC)</span> is an association of student group activities which was inaugurated on 2nd September 2006 by Dr. T. Hanuman Chowdary, former IT Adviser to Government of Andhra Pradesh. The main thought of forming up of this association is that the students are found to be completely engaged with their academic studies and have no recreation to polish their skills and talents. Though there are so many built-in qualities in them, they were lagging behind in this competitive world, as they have no time to concentrate on such matters. As the students spend most of their valuable time in the college campus itself, they must be given a chance of providing themselves in front of the experienced persons.
                    </p>
                    <img src="../images/seamic.jpg" alt="seamic-logo" id="seamic-img">
                </div><br>
                <p>Hence that gave rise to a thought of making "The buds flower up with their fragrance", which could be made possible with this association called "SEAMIC" with its motto "Destiny Through Innovation".</p>
                <h3>Theme of the Association:</h3>
                <p>The main theme of formation of student group is to make them active, be aware of all the latest trends and competitions that arise in the academics and other activities. The outcome of which is to make them competent and all-time outstanding achievers. The overall concentration is in improving their communication skills, self-management of tasks, making them bold enough to face the competitive world, making them gain excess knowledge other than book-knowledge and finally to make them build-up brotherhood relations in public.</p>
                <h3>Role of Students:</h3>
                <p>This association is mainly comprised of students. This is because students should be able to learn many issues like managing and doing tasks other than what they regularly study in classrooms. The whole program planning, organization and the participations are taken over by the students under proper guidance of the faculty members. A student body - the representatives of different aspects are selected and guided by the faculty to carry out the whole program implementation.</p>
                <h3>Achieving the Target:</h3>
                <p>The members and the faculty of the CSE Department are confident to achieve the theme of the association as we have already proved that our students are so talented as they were able to initiate themselves in sketching out the Logo of the association that depicts "A human empowering the knowledge of Computers". Also the motto and title of the association are being selected from a list of competing entries that were collected from the students. Though it takes some time to achieve the target, we assure that we have made up a path that leads them towards the destiny through their innovations.</p>
                <h3>Activities of SEAMIC:</h3>

                <p>
                    Mechanical Engineering is one of the major activities in the engineering profession and its principles are involved in the design, study, development, and construction of all the physical devices and systems. Continued research and development in Mechanical Engineering have led to the creation of better machines and processes helping the mankind.
                    <br><br>
                    The Department of Mechanical Engineering at DVR & Dr. HS MIC College of Technology is as old as the Institute itself. Its impact on the institute and on society is easily demonstrated by noting the alignment of the department's evolution with key events and technological advances in India and elsewhere.
                    <br><br>
                    The students in the department are exposed to the problems faced by today’s societies and are trained to address those problems through innovative thinking strategies to develop appropriate technological solutions. They endeavour to provide solutions to the practical problems. The faculty members of the department drive these activities through their teaching and diverse research programs covering numerous facets of Mechanical Engineering and its applications. In addition to the regular academic work, the students of the department are encouraged to participate in co-curricular activities. The department has evolved over time to keep up with the ever-increasing challenges in technology development, while maintaining a strong base in the fundamental aspects of Mechanical Engineering. While much of today’s research in Mechanical Engineering is of interdisciplinary nature requiring knowledge from numerous other science and engineering disciplines, the research work of the faculty members of the department is categorized into three broad streams viz., Thermal Engineering, Design Engineering, and Manufacturing Engineering, among others.
                    <br><br>
                    The department was accredited by the National Board of Accreditation (NBA) for a period of 3 years for UG in 2016. It was reaccredited in 2019. The department has entered into MoUs with leading Industries like CADD Experts, Vijayawada; Sudhakar Polymers Limited, Suryapet; Vasantha Hydraulic Systems, Hyderabad; Harsha Liners Pvt.Ltd., and AP Leaf Springs Pvt.Ltd., among others.
